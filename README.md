Intent ~
Due to recent restrictions many of us have found it hard to be productive at home. Focus city helps us by making task taking a bit more fun and hopefully stray off from procrastinating on our phones all day.

Platform ~
Focus city is an Android Mobile Application written in Android Studio with Java.

Installation ~
The app can be run through the Android Studio IDE or installing a APK file on a Android Device.
1. Download the APK file from the provided Google Drive Link ~ https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hmUgQLBJ6f-H1CCggZg4fKXIz42qsTYv?usp=sharing
2. Install the APK file on your Android device and enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your device settings if prompted.
3. Run the app as usual

ToDo ~
1. Add a city view so that the user can view all their buildings on a plot of land.
2. Prevent the user from exiting the app without destroying a building.
3. Add statistics so that users can track their progress.

Challenges ~
1. Working with Activities and Fragments.
2. Communicating between app pages. 
3. Storing and retrieving data with SQLite.

Notes ~
This app was inspired by The Forest: Stay Focused but I included new features that I felt was missing in that app.
The Minutes have been converted to Seconds for testing purposes. Change the TIME_SCALE Constant in MainActivity for normal usage.
